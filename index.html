							I graduated from the University of Texas at Austin in 2013 with a degree in History.
							After graduation, I went to work at a local start up as a marketing analyst. This role has allowed me to gain experience
							with HTML, CSS, and SQL, as well as many life lessons and some invaluable friendships. 
							<br><br>
							I first moved to Austin for school in 2009, where I have lived ever since. From the green belt to the endless supply of live music, I'm happy to make Austin my home and I hope to be able to further my career in this wonderful city.
